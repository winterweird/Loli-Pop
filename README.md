# Loli Pop
A 2D Point-and-Click Shooter game made with Python 3.3 and Pygame

Contains the source code and data files for Loli Pop. To run this game, you need Python installed on your computer, as well as the appropriate Pygame installation. This game works with Python 3.X - it is not backward compatible with Python 2.X, and will raise a TypeError exception (and a spoiler) if you try running it using a 2.X interpreter.

Please keep in mind that the folder structure is important. Don't mess with it, or it will break everything.

This game has not been performance optimized, as it was not necessary on my computer. The code is also messy and contains a lot of hardcoding, because I was more concerned about getting features working quickly than I was about creating a sound structure. This kept me more motivated throughout the development process. I am planning a rewrite of the code which creates a better structure, removes the hardcoding, and ultimately allows for customization of the game.
